# gRPSQLite

gRPC + SQLite

Multitenant, metered, bottomless, infinite SQLite databases backed by anything you can dream of. Implement by making a gRPC server and using a pre-made VFS.

Give every user, whether human or AI, as many SQLite databases as they want.

Uses real SQLite, so it works with everything that SQLite does (packages, extensions, apps, etc.)

_Yes, the name is a pun._
